Welcome to LIT Devs! We make software. Yeah, you'll be surprised by that. Are you surprised? Are you?

## Projects

We're working on [Vukkybox](https://vukkybox.com), a [gachapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon)-like webgame where you can collect over 300 mysterious creatures known as Vukkies, and [SaladBind](https://github.com/vukkyltd/saladbind), an open source tool for the [Salad](https://salad.com) application.

Both of these projects use Node.js as their backend, which is our language of choice at the moment. More stuff is coming soon. As in, very soon. Or maybe not very soon. I don't know!
