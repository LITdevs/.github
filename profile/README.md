Welcome to LIT Devs! We make software. Yeah, you'll be surprised by that. Are you surprised? Are you?

## Projects

We're working on [Vukkybox](https://vukkybox.com), a [gachapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon)-like webgame where you can collect over 300 mysterious creatures known as Vukkies, and [SaladBind](https://github.com/vukkyltd/saladbind), an open source tool for the [Salad](https://salad.com) application.

Both of these projects use Node.js as their backend, which is our language of choice at the moment. More stuff is coming soon. As in, very soon. Or maybe not very soon. I don't know!

SaladBind has over **10,000** downloads, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/litdevs) with over 1,000 members, and over 300 users have signed up to Vukkybox.

We allow users to submit their own Vukkies into Vukkybox. Over 80 Vukkies (**180** if you count Pukkies, Vukkies created by volunteers that can be used as profile pictures on social media) in the game were created using this method.
