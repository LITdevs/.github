Welcome to LIT Devs!

## Who are you, anyway?
<img align="left" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukkyy/vukmoji/master/emojis/static/vukkyconfused.png">

We're a team of two ([Vukky](https://sus.omg.lol) and [Skelly](https://profile.omg.lol/null)) creating some random software, you know, just for fun!

LIT Devs was founded in June of 2020, and we're not planning to stop making things any time soon. Abandoned projects are stored in the [LIT Devs archive](https://github.com/LITdevs-archive).

## So what are you making?
<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukkyy/vukmoji/master/emojis/static/vukkyminer.png">

We're working on [Vukkybox](https://vukkybox.com), a [gachapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon)-like webgame where you can collect over 300 mysterious creatures known as Vukkies, and [SaladBind](https://github.com/vukkyltd/saladbind), an open source tool for the [Salad](https://salad.com) application.

Both of these projects use Node.js as their backend, which is our language of choice at the moment. More stuff is coming soon. As in, very soon. Or maybe not very soon. I don't know!


## Cool! But does anyone care?

SaladBind has over **22,000** downloads, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/litdevs) with over 1,000 members, and over 300 users have signed up to Vukkybox.

We allow users to submit their own Vukkies into Vukkybox. Over **200**\* of the Vukkies in the game were created using this method[.](https://vukkybox.com/crash)
